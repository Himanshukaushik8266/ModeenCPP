class in h and cpp
if comes composition use shared pointer
if comes aggregation use refernce wrapper 

use of const , explicit and overrride keyword is mandatory

in functionalities use proper comment before witing the logic.


in inheritance there must be a question of dynamic casting if there is a pure virtual function

in that case use virtual destructor just to make sure that your destructor of parent class must called


make sure to clear memory and handle the segmentation fault iussure if using pointer


if possible avoid the use of pointer 



Don't forget nothing is bigger than your understanding of problem .
