Abstraction:
    Not providing the implemetation details so that 
        a) It can be provided at a later point in the code hierarchy
        b) We can explain functionality without significant focus on implemetation details 
Inheritance:
    Either you specialise the implementation for a specific sub category 
                     OR 
    You develop a logic which can be generalised to many types.

Polymorphism:
    If there a multiple ways to solve a problem according to context.






    const :
        Rule 1:  Const is applied to the token on its immediate left if there is nothing to the left of const apply const on the token to its right;
        Rule 2:  Pointer symbol * is considered as separate token.
